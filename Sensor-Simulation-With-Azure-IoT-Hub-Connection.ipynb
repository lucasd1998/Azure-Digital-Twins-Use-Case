    "# This Python script simulates 3 different sensors. The sensors can record the temperature and humidity. \n",
    "# For this use case, three identical sensors are created in Azure IoT Hub: \"Room0\", \"Room1\" and \"Room3\". The script then \n",
    "# connects to the devices created in Azure IoT Hub, which represent the sensors. The simulated data for temperature and \n",
    "# humidity is sent to these every 10 seconds.\n",
